JUSTIFICATION TECHNIQUES: 

Loop Invariant
==============

An Invariant Loop is a condition that remains true before and after each iteration of a loop. It is a theoretical tool used in computer science to help test the correctness of algorithms, especially those that use loops.

Real example: 

Insertion Sort Algorithm

def sort_by_insert(array:list):
    for item in range(len(1, array)):
	currentArrayItem = array[item]

	leftIndex = item-1

	while leftIndex >= 0 and currentArrayItem < array[leftIndex]
